Self Learning

A-Z machine learning
start/re start

Part 1 Data Pre processing
0> Start Spyder on machine
1> Start from Section 2 { Data Pre Processing}
2> For all the datasets go to https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning
3> For ignoring .idea files in Intellij. Goto file -> Settings -> VCS -> Ignored Files -> Point to .idea folder
4> Look at Data.csv . The forst three columns are independent variables whras the last column is dependent variable

Import the dataset
Numpy to include any type of mathematics in our code
Matpltlib.Pyplot for plotting nice charts
Pandas for importing and managing datasets
%.0f 0 0 for number of digits after decimal and f for float
iloc gets rows (or columns) at particular positions in the index (so it only takes integers).

Missing Data

Replace empty data with missing data
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer -- import Imputer class from preprocessing library
Impute means assigned to something by inference from the value of the products or processes to which it contributes; estimated.
Ctrl + I -> For inspecting a class in Spyder/python


imputer = Imputer(missing_values='Nan',strategy='mean', axis=0)
Nan are missing values as per dataset in explorer,
mean is the strategy using which we are going to replace the missing values
axis is 0 meaning we are imputing along the columns

imputer.fit(X[:, 1,3])
X taking all the lines and colunm one and two. 3 is upper bound which is not included

Note Country and Purchased are categorical data simply because they contain categories so now we need to encode that
since machine learning models are nothing but mathematical equations and we only want numbers in the equations

LabelEncoder will give 0,1,2 for Germany Spain and France
but since their is no order between all three and all three are independent
so we do not want ml model to give precedence to France>Spain>Germany.
So we will add as many columns as categories and in each col for that particular category as 1 and remaining cols will be zero

For Germany
Germany Spain France
1       0     0


Feature scaling is done so that no variable is dominated by other
For this we use two techniques
1> Standardization
2> Normalization

X{stand} = (x - mean(x))/standard deviation (x)

X{norm} = (x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))
